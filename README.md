# Skin Clinic Manager

This project implemented as part of the 5COSC019C coursework on Object-Oriented Programming.

## Project Overview

The Skin Clinic Manager System is designed to facilitate the management of a skin consultation centre. It provides functionality for adding and deleting doctors, booking and canceling consultations, and maintaining a list of doctors and their information. The system includes both a console-based menu interface and a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.

## Features

- Add a new doctor to the system, including relevant information such as name, surname, date of birth, and mobile number.
- Delete a doctor from the system by selecting their medical licence number.
- Print the list of doctors in the consultation centre, ordered alphabetically by surname.
- Save all entered information to a file for persistence across application sessions.
- Open a GUI to view and interact with the list of doctors.
- Sort the list of doctors alphabetically in the GUI.
- Book consultations with specific doctors, considering doctor availability, patient information, cost, and notes.
- Encrypt and store consultation notes for data privacy.
- Visualize and edit stored consultation information in the GUI.
